Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion from the data is that May shows the highest level of success. Although May also has the highest number of failures, the difference between the 2 trend lines are at its peak in May. 
My second conclusion is that we want to stay away from Launching in December. The number of failed and successful are roughly the same in December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Goals less than $1000 has the highest success rate. Looking at the data, they have a 71% success rate. I would recommend that our goal should be less than $5,000. We have a 66% success rate with $1000-$4999 and 71% with <$1000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation that applies to today's enviroment is the effects of Covid. Right now, it might be a bad idea to put on a play. The level of success is likely to drop due to exposure of the virus. This also, might be a good reason to launch in warmer months. Something else that I have noticed is the Country categroy. I'm interested to know the succcess of plays within the countries. Perhaps the data can be better anlayzed by identifying Cities, rather than countries.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For the Launch date, I  think a bar graph or histogram would be a great way to compare the data.
For the outcomes, Percentage based results are great to see in a pie graph. This might not be too favorable here with all of the categories, but still fun to try.
